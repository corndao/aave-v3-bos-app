Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.\n\n The AAVE v3 BOS component is built by Cornerstone team: https://github.com/corndao/aave-v3-bos-app \n\n ![](https://ipfs.near.social/ipfs/bafkreiaxpkaivtd7ldofxdxdlew5y7pvvrdj24rdubv6ksrzjk7zwgrb2i)",
